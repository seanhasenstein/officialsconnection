		<h5>2016 CAMP INFORMATION:</h5>
		<p>This High School officials camp is in conjunction with Mark Millerâ€™s WI Basketball Yearbook Boys Varsity High School Tournament and hosted at Kaukauna High School and Plymouth High School and Riverview Middle School.</p>
		<p>This camp specifically focuses on improving the skill levels of all officials, whether you are beginning your training, improving, or enhancing your game. This camp will train and develop the importance to officials in all aspects of either 2 person and 3 person officiating, with knowledge and understanding of mechanics, positioning, and communication. With our experienced group of clinicians (that have been a part of this camp for many years), will teach and help you develop your game to that next level on the court. Their dedication to YOU in this camp, is to improve what YOU want to improve on and where YOU want to go in your officiating career. As an official you need to get to camps each year, continuing your education and providing you the opportunity to get to that next level.</p> 
		<p>This high school camp has been approved by the WIAA once again and is accredited towards 2 and 3 person certification and classification upgrade per WIAA officials handbook guide.</p>
		<p>We have conference assignors from the FRCC, Bay, the new North Eastern, the new Big East, Trailways, Flyway and others scheduled to attend our camp throughout the weekend also. This  gives you the opportunity to showcase your officiating skills as you work on the court. Through the years of this camp, many, many officials have been rewarded with varsity games in many area conferences. With the assignors continuing to add 3 person crews to their respective conferences, gives you the opportunity to show them and for you to step ahead in your varsity schedule by attending this camp.</p>
		<p>The high school camp will be divided into 4 sessions once again, which allows for you to attend 1 day of training or multiple days if you would like extra training and focus on your game in 2 or 3 person mechanics. First session is for classification levels of Master and L5 officials only, focusing on 3 person training on Friday afternoon/evening, Second session is for classification levels of Master, L5, L4, L3 officials focusing on 3 person training on Saturday morning/afternoon, Third session is for all officials classification levels, focusing on both 2 and 3 person training on, Saturday afternoon/evening. Fourth session on Sunday morning/afternoon is also for all officials classification levels, again focusing on both 2 and 3 person training.. Each session would consist of approximately working 3/4 games, 2 and 3 person classroom lectures &amp; film review. Each official will receive a game film during their session and a camp gift. Food and refreshments is provided. REMEMBER, you can attend more than one session!!</p> 
		<h4>NEW! NEW! THIS YEAR AT PLYMOUTH CAMP - Friday and Saturday</h4>

Don Baumgart will be heading up this new junior college training to the Plymouth Camp. More information to follow on this camp training to everyone.</p>
