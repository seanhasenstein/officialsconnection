		<h5>2016 CAMP INFORMATION:</h5>
		<p>This College officials camp is in conjunction with Mark Millerâ€™s WI Basketball Yearbook Boys Varsity High School Tournament and hosted at Plymouth High School and Riverview Middle School.</p>
		<p>This camp specifically focuses on improving the skill levels of all officials, whether you are beginning your training, improving, or enhancing your game. This camp will train and develop the importance to officials in all aspects of officiating, with knowledge and understanding of mechanics, positioning, and communication. With our experienced group of clinicians (that have been a part of this camp for many years), will teach and help you develop your game to that next level on the court. Their dedication to YOU in this camp, is to improve what YOU want to improve on and where YOU want to go in your officiating career. As an official you need to get to camps each year, continuing your education and providing you the opportunity to get to that next level.</p> 
		<p>Each session will consist of approximately working 3/4 games, classroom lectures &amp; film review. Each official will receive a game film during their session and a camp gift. Food and refreshments is provided. REMEMBER, you can attend more than one session!!</p> 
		<p>Don Baumgart will be heading up this new college training to the Plymouth Camp. More information to follow on this camp training to everyone.</p>
		<p>So if you want to work the best boys varsity basketball in the area for your officials camp experience, and get seen by game assignors at high school and college levels, take advantage of the weekend to get certified for your high school training Friday, Saturday or Sunday, and college training on Friday or Saturday.</p>
