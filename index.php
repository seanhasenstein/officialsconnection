		<h5>2016 CAMP INFORMATION:</h5>
			<p>Our camps are in conjunction with Mark Millerâ€™s WI Basketball Yearbook Boys Varsity High School Tournament and hosted at Kaukauna High School and Plymouth High School and Riverview Middle School.</p>
			<p>This camp specifically focuses on improving the skill levels of all officials, whether you are beginning your training, improving, or enhancing your game. This camp will train and develop the importance to officials in all aspects of either 2 person and 3 person officiating, with knowledge and understanding of mechanics, positioning, and communication. Our experienced group of clinicians (that have been a part of this camp for many years), will teach and help you develop your game to that next level. Their dedication to YOU in this camp, is to improve what YOU want to improve on and where YOU want to go in your officiating career. As an official it is vital that you get to camps each year, to continue your education and provide you the opportunity to get to that next level.</p>
			
			<p>Each session would consist of approximately working 3/4 games, 2 and 3 person classroom lectures &amp; film review.  Each official will receive a game film during their session and a camp gift.  Food and refreshments is provided. REMEMBER, you can attend more than one session!!</p>
			<h4>NEW! NEW! THIS YEAR AT PLYMOUTH CAMP - Friday and Saturday</h4>
			<p>For those officials that have previously worked College basketball games or officials that are looking to move ahead to this level in their career, will have the opportunity to attend this camp on Friday and Saturday only! Don Baumgart will be heading up this new college training to the Plymouth Camp. More information to follow on this camp training...</p>
			<p>So if you want to work the best boys varsity basketball in the area for your officials camp experience, and get seen by game assignors at high school and college levels, take advantage of the weekend to get certified for your high school training Friday, Saturday or Sunday, and college training on Friday or Saturday.</p>
